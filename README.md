# NBM 5.0 Verification

A comprehensive verification framework for evaluating the performance of the National Blend of Models (NBM) version 5.0.

## Project Overview

This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks designed to:

1. **Verify NBM 5.0 performance** against ground truth observations.
2. **Generate comprehensive reports** for field-level trust and buy-in.
3. **Provide interactive analysis tools and reproducible workflows.**

## Key Updates

- **Custom GRIB Decoder**: Added for NBMv5-specific data processing.
- **Simplified Repository Structure**: Focused on essential scripts and notebooks.
- **CSV Files Ignored**: Large `.csv` files are excluded from version control.
