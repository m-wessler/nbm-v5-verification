# Shapefiles Directory

This directory should contain shapefiles for River Forecast Centers (RFCs).

## Expected Files

Place RFC shapefiles here. Typical files include:
- `*.shp` - Shapefile geometry
- `*.shx` - Shape index
- `*.dbf` - Attribute table
- `*.prj` - Projection information

## Data Sources

RFC shapefiles can be obtained from:
- National Weather Service GIS data portal
- NOAA's public data repositories

## File Naming

Files should follow a consistent naming convention for the verification system to recognize them.
